Topic: Well-Architected Framework (AWS, Azure, GCP)

1. What is the Well-Architected Framework?
Why does it exist? What breaks if we ignore it?
What it is
The Well-Architected Framework (WAF) is a set of design principles used to evaluate whether a system is:
	•	Reliable
	•	Secure
	•	Scalable
	•	Cost-effective
	•	Operable
	•	Future-proof
It is not a tool. It is a way of thinking about system design.

Why it exists
Cloud systems fail not because of:
	•	Bad code
	•	Weak hardware
They fail because of:
	•	Poor design decisions
	•	Lack of visibility
	•	Ignoring failure modes
	•	Overengineering or underengineering
	•	Cost blind spots
The Well-Architected Framework exists to:
	•	Prevent architectural debt
	•	Force tradeoff awareness
	•	Align engineering with business goals
	•	Reduce outages and surprises

What breaks if you ignore it
If you don’t follow these principles:
	•	Systems become fragile
	•	Costs spiral out of control
	•	Scaling breaks unpredictably
	•	Security gaps appear
	•	Operations become reactive
	•	Cloud bills explode
Most production outages are architecture failures, not code failures.

2. Core Pillars (Common Across AWS / Azure / GCP)
All three cloud providers follow the same core ideas, even if names differ.
Pillar						Purpose
Operational Excellence		Run and improve systems
Security					Protect data & systems
Reliability					Recover from failure
Performance Efficiency		Use resources efficiently
Cost Optimization			Avoid waste
Sustainability (new)		Minimize environmental impact

3. Operational Excellence
What it means
The ability to:
	•	Monitor systems
	•	Detect failures
	•	Respond quickly
	•	Improve continuously

Key Principles
	•	Infrastructure as Code
	•	Automation over manual work
	•	Observability
	•	Continuous improvement
	•	Runbooks and playbooks

Real-World Example
Bad:
	•	Manual deployments
	•	No monitoring
	•	No rollback strategy
Good:
	•	CI/CD pipelines
	•	Automated rollback
	•	Metrics + alerts
	•	Post-incident reviews

Think Like a System Owner
Ask:
	•	Can I deploy without downtime?
	•	Can I detect failures automatically?
	•	Can I roll back in minutes?
	•	Can a junior engineer operate this system?
If not → architecture is weak.

Cloud Mapping
AWS:
	•	CloudWatch
	•	CloudTrail
	•	AWS Config
	•	Systems Manager
Azure:
	•	Azure Monitor
	•	Application Insights
	•	Log Analytics
GCP:
	•	Cloud Monitoring
	•	Cloud Logging
	•	Error Reporting

4. Security
What it means
Protect:
	•	Data
	•	Systems
	•	Users
	•	Access paths
Security is not a feature — it’s a design constraint.

Core Principles
	•	Least privilege
	•	Defense in depth
	•	Identity-first security
	•	Encrypt everything
	•	Zero trust

Real-World Failures
Common causes:
	•	Over-permissioned IAM roles
	•	Public storage buckets
	•	Hardcoded secrets
	•	No network segmentation

Think Like a System Owner
Ask:
	•	What happens if credentials leak?
	•	Can an intern delete prod?
	•	Is data encrypted at rest and in transit?
	•	Can I audit every action?

Cloud Mapping
AWS:
	•	IAM
	•	KMS
	•	Security Groups
	•	GuardDuty
Azure:
	•	Azure AD
	•	Key Vault
	•	Defender
GCP:
	•	IAM
	•	Secret Manager
	•	VPC Service Controls

5. Reliability
What it means
The system:
	•	Handles failures gracefully
	•	Recovers automatically
	•	Scales with demand

Core Principles
	•	Assume failure
	•	Design for recovery
	•	Automate healing
	•	Test failure scenarios
	•	Use redundancy

Real-World Examples
Good:
	•	Multi-AZ databases
	•	Auto scaling
	•	Health checks
Bad:
	•	Single region deployment
	•	Manual failover
	•	No backups

Think Like a System Owner
Ask:
	•	What happens if a region goes down?
	•	Can my system heal itself?
	•	Do I know my RTO/RPO?
	•	Have I tested failover?

Cloud Mapping
AWS:
	•	Multi-AZ RDS
	•	ELB
	•	Auto Scaling
	•	Route 53
Azure:
	•	Availability Zones
	•	Traffic Manager
	•	Site Recovery
GCP:
	•	Multi-region services
	•	Load Balancing
	•	Spanner replication

6. Performance Efficiency
What it means
Use the right resource type for the job at the right time.

Key Concepts
	•	Right-sizing
	•	Auto-scaling
	•	Caching
	•	Serverless where possible
	•	Avoid overprovisioning

Real-World Example
Bad:
	•	Fixed-size EC2 for spiky traffic
	•	No caching
	•	Over-provisioned DB
Good:
	•	Auto-scaling
	•	CDN
	•	Serverless APIs
	•	Async processing

Think Like a System Owner
Ask:
	•	Are resources idle?
	•	Are we scaling automatically?
	•	Are we using managed services?
	•	Are we measuring performance?

Cloud Mapping
AWS:
	•	Auto Scaling
	•	Lambda
	•	CloudFront
Azure:
	•	App Service scaling
	•	Azure Functions
	•	CDN
GCP:
	•	Cloud Run
	•	Autoscaling groups
	•	Cloud CDN

7. Cost Optimization
What it means
Spend money intentionally, not accidentally.

Core Principles
	•	Measure everything
	•	Eliminate waste
	•	Match cost to business value
	•	Use managed services
	•	Optimize storage tiers

Real-World Cost Killers
	•	Idle EC2 instances
	•	Overprovisioned databases
	•	Unused storage
	•	Unbounded logs
	•	Forgotten test environments

Think Like a System Owner
Ask:
	•	Which service costs the most?
	•	Is it justified?
	•	Can it scale down?
	•	Can it be serverless?

Cloud Mapping
AWS:
	•	Cost Explorer
	•	Budgets
	•	Savings Plans
Azure:
	•	Cost Management
	•	Advisor
GCP:
	•	Cost Table
	•	Recommender

8. Sustainability (New Pillar)
What it means
Reduce environmental impact by:
	•	Using efficient services
	•	Reducing idle compute
	•	Optimizing storage
	•	Using regions with cleaner energy

Why It Matters
	•	Regulatory pressure
	•	Cost reduction
	•	Corporate ESG goals

9. Interview Perspective
How to Explain the Well-Architected Framework
Say:
“The Well-Architected Framework helps design cloud systems that are secure, reliable, cost-effective, and scalable by forcing architects to think in terms of tradeoffs rather than just features.”
Then explain:
	•	One pillar in detail
	•	A real example
	•	A tradeoff you made

What Interviewers Look For
	•	System thinking
	•	Tradeoff awareness
	•	Failure-first mindset
	•	Cost awareness
	•	Practical experience

Common Mistakes
	•	Treating it as theory
	•	Ignoring cost pillar
	•	Overengineering
	•	Ignoring observability
	•	Designing without failure scenarios

Final Takeaway
The Well-Architected Framework is not documentation.
It is:
	•	A decision-making lens
	•	A risk-reduction tool
	•	A maturity model
	•	A way to think like a cloud architect
Great architects:
	•	Design for failure
	•	Measure everything
	•	Automate aggressively
	•	Optimize continuously
	•	Align tech with business
