Topic: CAP vs ACID vs BASE

1. What is it? Why does it exist? What breaks if we don’t understand it?
What these concepts represent
These three concepts answer different questions, but are often confused.
	•	CAP → How distributed systems behave under network failure
	•	ACID → Guarantees provided by traditional databases
	•	BASE → A relaxed consistency model for distributed systems
They exist because scalability, correctness, and availability pull systems in different directions.
If you don’t understand the difference:
	•	You design systems that don’t scale
	•	You pick the wrong database
	•	You mis-handle failures
	•	You promise guarantees your system cannot provide

2. CAP Theorem (Distributed System Perspective)
What CAP Says
In a distributed system, when a network partition occurs, you must choose between:
	•	Consistency (C) – All nodes see the same data
	•	Availability (A) – System responds to every request
	•	Partition Tolerance (P) – System survives network failures
You can only choose two.
What CAP Really Means
CAP only applies when a network partition happens.
Since partitions are inevitable in distributed systems:
	•	You must choose between Consistency or Availability

CAP in Practice
Choice
Meaning
CP
Correct but may reject requests
AP
Always responds but may return stale data
CA
Only possible in non-distributed systems

3. ACID (Database Consistency Model)
What ACID Means
ACID defines transaction guarantees in databases:
	•	Atomicity – All or nothing
	•	Consistency – Data always valid
	•	Isolation – Transactions don’t interfere
	•	Durability – Data survives failures
ACID focuses on correctness of data, not distribution.

Why ACID Exists
ACID exists because:
	•	Financial systems require correctness
	•	Partial updates are unacceptable
	•	Data corruption is catastrophic
ACID is about trust.

ACID in Practice
ACID works well when:
	•	System runs on a single node or tightly coupled cluster
	•	Latency is acceptable
	•	Scaling is vertical
But ACID struggles when:
	•	You scale across regions
	•	You need high availability
	•	You need low latency globally

4. BASE (Distributed System Alternative)
What BASE Means
BASE is an alternative to ACID designed for distributed systems:
	•	Basically Available – System always responds
	•	Soft State – State may change over time
	•	Eventually Consistent – Data will become consistent later
BASE accepts inconsistency to achieve:
	•	Scalability
	•	Availability
	•	Fault tolerance

Why BASE Exists
BASE exists because:
	•	ACID does not scale globally
	•	Network partitions are inevitable
	•	High availability is often more important than correctness
BASE is a practical compromise, not a flaw.

5. How CAP, ACID, and BASE Relate
Key Insight
These are not competing theories. They apply at different layers.
Concept  Scope
ACID      Database transaction behavior
BASE      Distributed data behavior
CAP       System behavior under failure

Relationship Summary
	•	ACID focuses on correctness
	•	BASE focuses on availability and scalability
	•	CAP explains why you must choose

6. Tradeoffs Explained Clearly
Consistency vs Availability
	•	ACID favors consistency
	•	BASE favors availability
Latency vs Correctness
	•	ACID systems are slower
	•	BASE systems are faster
Simplicity vs Scale
	•	ACID is easier to reason about
	•	BASE scales better
Cost vs Reliability
	•	ACID costs more at scale
	•	BASE reduces infrastructure cost

7. Think Like a System Owner
Failure Scenario 1: Payment System
If using ACID:
	•	Transaction blocks until confirmed
	•	No double charges
	•	Higher latency
	•	Possible downtime
Correct choice.

Failure Scenario 2: Social Media Feed
If using ACID:
	•	Feed updates slow
	•	System becomes expensive
	•	Poor user experience
Correct choice:
	•	BASE
	•	Eventual consistency
	•	Async updates

Failure Scenario 3: Inventory System
Correct approach:
	•	Stock deduction → ACID
	•	Product views → BASE
	•	Reviews → BASE
Hybrid architecture is the real-world solution.

8. Operational Perspective
ACID Challenges
	•	Hard to scale
	•	Expensive
	•	Tight coupling
	•	Limited global distribution
BASE Challenges
	•	Debugging inconsistencies
	•	Event reconciliation
	•	Complex business logic
	•	Conflict resolution

9. Cloud Service Mapping
AWS
	•	ACID:
	◦	RDS
	◦	Aurora
	•	BASE:
	◦	DynamoDB
	◦	S3
Azure
	•	ACID:
	◦	Azure SQL
	•	BASE:
	◦	Cosmos DB
GCP
	•	ACID:
	◦	Cloud Spanner
	•	BASE:
	◦	Bigtable
	◦	Firestore

10. Interview Perspective
How to Explain It Simply
Say:
“ACID ensures correctness inside a database. BASE enables scalability in distributed systems. CAP explains why we must trade consistency for availability when failures occur.”
Then explain:
	•	Which one your system uses
	•	Why that choice was made
	•	What tradeoffs were accepted

What Interviewers Look For
	•	Clear understanding of tradeoffs
	•	Ability to apply concepts practically
	•	Awareness of distributed system behavior
	•	Business-driven reasoning

Common Mistakes
	•	Thinking ACID and BASE are competitors
	•	Applying ACID everywhere
	•	Ignoring network partitions
	•	Assuming strong consistency is always better

Final Takeaway
	•	ACID = correctness
	•	BASE = scalability
	•	CAP = reality of distributed systems
Great architects:
	•	Use ACID where correctness matters
	•	Use BASE where scale matters
	•	Use CAP to make informed tradeoffs
	•	Design systems, not theories
