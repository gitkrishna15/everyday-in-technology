Manufacturing / Industry 4.0 – Smart Factory Platform

Industry: Manufacturing, Industrial IoT
Examples: Automotive plant, electronics factory, process manufacturing

Sensor data from machines is first processed at the factory edge to reduce latency and bandwidth.
Data is securely streamed to the cloud ingestion layer, where it flows through high-throughput streaming services.
Real-time processors update time-series databases and trigger events, while raw telemetry is stored for analytics.
Machine-learning models trained on historical data predict failures and optimize operations.
The platform is fully observable, secure, automated via CI/CD and IaC, and integrated with enterprise ERP systems.


Key characteristics:
  Thousands of machines & sensors
  High-frequency telemetry (milliseconds)
  Edge + cloud hybrid by necessity
  Predictive maintenance (ML)
  Real-time dashboards for operators
  Strong segregation between OT & IT networks


Core Problems This Architecture Solves
  Collecting sensor data from PLCs & machines
  Processing data close to machines (edge)
  Streaming massive telemetry to cloud
  Detecting anomalies & predicting failures
  Long-term analytics & optimization
  Secure integration with enterprise IT (ERP)
