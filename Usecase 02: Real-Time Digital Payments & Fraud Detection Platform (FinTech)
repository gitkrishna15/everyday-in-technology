Real-Time Digital Payments & Fraud Detection Platform (FinTech)

Industry: FinTech / Payments
Examples: UPI-like system, card payments, wallets

Payments enter through a secure edge protected by WAF and DDoS controls.
Requests are authenticated and routed to a highly scalable transaction engine running on VMs, Kubernetes, and serverless.
Critical financial data is stored in relational and immutable ledger stores.
Events are published to queues and streams for settlement, reconciliation, and fraud detection.
Streaming data feeds analytics and ML models that score transactions in real time.
The system is fully observable, auditable, automated via CI/CD and IaC, and protected with backups and hybrid connectivity to banks.


Key characteristics:
  Extremely low latency
  High transaction volume
  Strong security & compliance
  Event-driven processing
  Real-time fraud detection
  Auditable, immutable records
  Analytics + ML feedback loop


Core challenges this architecture solves:
  Burst traffic (salary day, sale events)
  Exactly-once or idempotent processing
  Async settlement workflows
  Near-real-time fraud scoring
  Regulatory auditability
  Zero data loss

How This Differs from the SaaS Architecture
  Aspect	              SaaS Learning Platform	          FinTech Payments Platform
  Latency sensitivity	  Medium	                          Ultra-low
  Data consistency	    Eventual OK	                      Strong consistency
  Async usage	          Background jobs	                  Critical transaction flow
  Security	            Important	                        Mission-critical
  Audit & compliance	  Light	                            Mandatory
  ML usage	            Recommendations	                  Real-time fraud scoring
