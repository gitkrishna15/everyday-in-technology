Healthcare Digital Health Platform (Hospitals + Patients + Labs)


Industry: Healthcare / HealthTech
Examples: Hospital Management System, Patient Portals, Lab Integration, Telemedicine

The platform securely serves patients and healthcare staff through a protected edge.
Requests are authenticated and routed to clinical microservices running on Kubernetes and VMs.
Patient records are stored in relational databases, while reports and images are stored in object and file storage.
Events from labs and devices flow through an event-driven integration layer into workflows and analytics.
Data is processed into a warehouse to power ML models that assist clinicians, while full audit, monitoring, and backup ensure regulatory compliance.


Key characteristics:
  Highly sensitive personal health data (PHI)
  Strong compliance (HIPAA-like requirements)
  Integration with external labs & devices
  Mix of real-time + batch workloads
  Long-term data retention
  ML-assisted diagnostics & insights


Core Problems This Architecture Solves
  Secure access for doctors, patients, admins
  Integration with labs, pharmacies, insurance
  Handling medical records (structured + unstructured)
  Event-driven updates (lab results, alerts)
  Analytics & ML for diagnosis support
  Full auditability & traceability
