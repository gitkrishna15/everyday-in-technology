Energy Smart Grid Platform

Industry: Energy, Utilities, Power Distribution

Telemetry from smart meters, substations, and renewable plants is first processed through edge and SCADA systems for local control.
Data is securely streamed into the cloud, where real-time processors update time-series and geospatial models of the grid.
Analytics and machine learning forecast load, detect faults, and predict outages.
Grid control services trigger alerts and corrective actions, while operations dashboards give operators real-time visibility.
The system is designed for resilience, regulatory compliance, and hybrid operation across edge, on-prem, and cloud.

Examples:
  State electricity boards
  National power grid operators
  Renewable energy integration (solar, wind)
  Smart meters & substations


What Makes Smart Grid Architecture UNIQUE?
  Dominant constraints:
    Power flows are continuous & physical
    Grid must survive partial failures
    Edge + on-prem SCADA systems are mandatory
    Decisions must be near-real-time
    Data is geospatial + time-series
    Regulatory audit is non-negotiable


Core Problems This Architecture Solves
  Collecting data from millions of smart meters
  Monitoring substations & transformers
  Detecting outages & load imbalance
  Integrating renewable energy sources
  Predicting demand & failures
  Coordinating grid operations across regions
