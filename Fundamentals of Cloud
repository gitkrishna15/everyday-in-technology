Fundamentals of Cloud : Modules


Module 1: Cloud Foundations and Concepts
• Definition and Evolution: Understanding the shift from traditional IT to cloud computing, including trends like on-demand self-service, resource pooling, and rapid elasticity.
• Service Models: In-depth study of SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS, exploring the scope of control between providers and consumers.
• Deployment Models: Comparison of Public, Private, Hybrid, and Community clouds.
• Business Value: Analysing the pros and cons of cloud adoption, including cost-effectiveness and pay-as-you-go pricing.

Module 2: Architectural Frameworks and Actors
• NIST Reference Architecture: Studying the five major actors: Cloud Consumer, Provider, Carrier, Auditor, and Broker.
• Solution Architecture: Introduction to different architecture types, such as Microservices, Monolithic, and Serverless (AWS Lambda).
• Global Infrastructure: Understanding Regions, Availability Zones, and Edge Locations.

Module 3: Core Cloud Services (Technical Deep Dive)
• Compute: Virtualisation basics, launching virtual servers (Amazon EC2), and managing containers.
• Storage Management: Object storage (Amazon S3), block storage (EBS), and long-term archival (Glacier), including storage classes and lifecycle management.
• Cloud Networking: Building secure networks using VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), Load Balancing, and DNS services like Route 53.
• Databases: Comparing Relational (RDS) and NoSQL (DynamoDB) solutions.

Module 4: Security, Governance, and Compliance
• The Shared Responsibility Model: Defining security obligations for both providers and consumers.
• Identity and Access Management (IAM): Role-based access control, policies, and authentication.
• Governance and Risk: Enterprise Risk Management, legal concepts, contracts, and electronic discovery.
• Compliance Standards: Global standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI.
• Infrastructure Security: Protecting at the network, host, and application levels.

Module 5: Cloud Operations and Migration
• Monitoring and Logging: Using tools like CloudWatch and CloudTrail for auditing and performance reporting.
• Migration Strategies: Identifying workloads for migration and understanding types such as re-host, re-platform, and re-factor.
• Business Continuity: Strategies for disaster recovery, backup, and maintaining high availability.

Module 6: Advanced Technologies and Innovation
• Data Analytics: Introduction to Big Data services like EMR and Redshift.
• Machine Learning and AI: Value propositions of ML and hands-on tasks with services like SageMaker or Google Cloud AI.
• APIs and Automation: Managing cloud resources through SDKs, CLI, and automation tools.
