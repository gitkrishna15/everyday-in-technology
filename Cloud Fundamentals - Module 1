Module 1 : Beyond the Hype: Understanding the DNA of Cloud Computing

The Paradigm Shift The shift from traditional IT to cloud computing represents a fundamental change in how we view technology resources. 
In the traditional model, organisations focused heavily on procuring, maintaining, and operating hardware. 
Today, cloud computing enables a shift towards innovative service creation, treating infrastructure as a utility rather than a capital-intensive project.


The Five Essential Characteristics According to the NIST Reference Architecture, a service must meet five specific criteria to be considered "cloud":
1. On-demand self-service: Users can provision computing capabilities automatically without human interaction with the provider.
2. Broad network access: Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms (e.g., mobile phones, laptops).
3. Resource pooling: The provider’s resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model.
4. Rapid elasticity: Resources can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly outward or inward based on demand.
5. Measured service: Cloud systems automatically control and optimise resource use by leveraging a metering capability.


Choosing Your Service Model (The SPI Model) Understanding the "Menu of Services" is critical for any professional:
• IaaS (Infrastructure): Provides fundamental computing resources like virtual servers and storage. You manage the OS and applications, while the provider manages the hardware.
• PaaS (Platform): Offers a framework for developers to build, test, and deploy applications without worrying about underlying infrastructure.
• SaaS (Software): Ready-to-use applications managed entirely by the provider, such as web-based email or office productivity tools.


Deployment Strategies Where does your data live?
• Public Cloud: Resources are available to the general public over a public network.
• Private Cloud: Operated solely for a single organisation, offering exclusive access.
• Hybrid Cloud: A composition of two or more clouds bound together by technology that enables data and application portability.
• Community Cloud: Shared by several organisations with common concerns (e.g., security or compliance requirements).


Conclusion: The Business Value The "Cloud-First" world is driven by a pay-as-you-go pricing model, which replaces heavy upfront costs with variable expenses that scale with your business. 
Whether you are a student or a professional, mastering these foundations is the first step toward high-demand roles like Cloud Infrastructure Analyst or Security Engineer
